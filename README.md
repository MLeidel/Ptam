# Ptam
a subset of "Pta" for textarea in mobile devices

Leaves out all of the functions based on keypresses except RETURN and TAB.

This permits the auto-indenture when RETURN is used on a touch device.
Tabs and group tabs continue to work as well, on keyboarded devices.

The alt-a portion of Pta.js's zen coding was added, but only useable on keyboard devices.
Similarly, a funtion to a figures by selecting lines was added.
